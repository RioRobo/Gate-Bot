Purpose:
    This robot will complete the first portion of the 2012 Competition.
    It makes its way to the gate blocking the path to the "toxic waste"
    area, and moves the gate out of the way. Once this is complete, 
    it returns home and signals to the muscle bot that all is well and
    the removal of the toxic waste can commence.

Current Status:
    Work in progress. Pickup and dropoff subsystem complete.
